# About
Every directory is an application idea and each of them contains:
1. `daas_layer_1.yaml`: For apps to be submitted to our platform. This is the user facing config.
2. `daas_layer_2.yaml`: This is the system facing config created for the layer 1 file.
3. `non_daas_layer_1.yaml`: For apps that user wants to run locally on his/her drone. This is the user facing config.
4. `non_daas_layer_2.yaml`: This is the system facing config created for the layer 1 file.

## Note
Start looking at this repo from the `vip_navigation` example since that has the most documented YAML files for now.
