# Doubts:
# 1. How do we justify just making the video and sending that video back for the user to work on it himself
# 2. Vs running a DNN model at our side real-time while monitoring the crops. This real-time becomes a necessity in wildfire or some disaster but is it a necessity for crop monitoring?
# 3. Is "crop_monitor" genuinely an app in our case for showcase purpose? Or just "video_record" is a useful enough app for any given set of lat long?

applications:
  # ---------------------------------- Good example for a power user due to custom models ----------------------------------
  # Crop monitoring will require specially trained model: For pests, disease etc
  # Since apps are composable piece of code by devs who submit them, I can define my own requirements that I want from a user for this app to run.
