# Survey task
# 1. Choose shape: Circular / Bounding box based
# 2. Choose survey type: Boundary / Zigzag
# 3. Choose camera focus (wherever applicable): Forward / Center (of the whole area to be surveyed)
# 4. Optional stuff: Sensor selection / Sensor configuration / Height

# Note: If the camera focus is "center" the drone needs to have some yaw calculated constantly to keep the focus in the center.
# Note: survey_columns: Number of zigzags to do in the area.
# Note: These should be composed from our navigation primitives only.

# Example 1 -> Basic survey around "boundary" a rectangular area
- primitive_type: survey
  primitive_category: navigation
  shape: bbox
  type: boundary
  camera_focus: center # {forward/center}
  height: 150 # cms
  velocity: 2.0 # something/s

# Example 2 -> Basic survey in a zigzag pattern in a rectangular area
- primitive_type: survey
  primitive_category: navigation
  shape: bbox
  type: zigzag
  survey_columns: 3 # how many zigzags to do
  camera_focus: forward # forward only
  height: 150 # cms
  velocity: 2.0 # something/s

# Example 3 -> Basic survey around "boundary" a circular area: Can be based on {gps anchor + radius / distance from current + radius }
- primitive_type: survey
  primitive_category: navigation
  shape: circular
  type: boundary # only boundary makes sense for circular
  radius: 1500 # cms
  anchor: # these should be mutually exclusive -> anchor around a gps location or make a circle of 'x' radius (distance)
    gps:
      lat: 38.8951
      long: -77.0364
    distance:
      radius: 500 # in cms
  camera_focus: forward # {forward/center}
  height: 150 # cms
  velocity: 2.0 # something/s

# Example 4 -> Complex survey with addition of "custom_analytics" attribute TBD
- primitive_type: survey
  primitive_category: navigation
  shape: circular
  type: boundary
  camera_focus: forward # {forward/center}
  height: 150 # cms
  velocity: 2.0 # something/s
  custom_analytics:
    - sensor_type: camera_primary
      sensor_topic: "/drone0/sensor/image"
      dnn_model:
        model_image: dreamlab:collision_avoidance_v1
        fps: 15
