# Some attributes might be mutually exclusive
# The goal is to make an exhaustive list for all the primitives

# Note: Normal users might not exposed to these primitives directly? Atleast in first iteration?
# Note: A lot of attributes might be mutually exclusive
# Note: A lot of primitives might have a sensible default

# ----------------- Level 2: Common (Basic combination of imperative controls) -----------------
- primitive_type: revolve # orbital motion from some object or an anchor point

  primitive_category: navigation
  conditions:
